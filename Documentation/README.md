# JCSlider

This is a collection of subclasses for UISlider, used to select a value from a continuous range of values. It makes use of blocks to respond to UIControlEvents.

* JCSlider
* JCStopSlider

So far JCStopSlider is the only special implementation included. It makes use of stop components to mark values the thumb control should snap to on touchUp. This can be alternatively described as an options slider as that is the intended use.
